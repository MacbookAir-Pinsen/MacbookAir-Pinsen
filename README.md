My name is Wang,Pin-Sen,
since studying Finance at NSYSU,
I have been passionate about financial data analysis and strategic planning, 
earning a proprietary trader certification through my skills in futures trading. 
Beyond strong academic performance, 
I actively participated in project planning and teamwork, 
demonstrating communication and creativity. 
During a short-term internship, 
I was exposed to ERP systems and SOP writing, 
which inspired my aspiration to integrate data analysis with manufacturing decisions. 
At NCKUâ€™s MBA program,
I aim to focus on smart manufacturing and operations management,
enhance my research skills and pursue a career as a senior executive in manufacturing management.
